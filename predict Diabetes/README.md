Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
1:Explore dataset features impact on outcome class.
2.If missing values are there,replace that with consideration of outcome class values.
3.Build a best model among logistic regression,KNN classifier,naive bayes and SVM classifier with optimum values of hyper-parameter.
4.You may use gridsearchCV for the same.
